# Euroviisubingo

A fun Eurovision Song Contest bingo game where players can mark off common Eurovision tropes and moments as they happen during the show.

The project is live at: [https://euroviisubingo.fi](https://euroviisubingo.fi)

The Eurovision Bingo project was created for entertainment purposes to make watching the Eurovision Song Contest even more fun. Players can mark off various Eurovision clich√©s and memorable moments on their bingo cards as they occur during the live broadcast.

This project was inspired by the non-digital versions of Eurovision Bingo published by the [Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle)](https://yle.fi/a/74-20156509).
