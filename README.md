# Euroviisubingo

A fun Eurovision Song Contest bingo game where players can mark off common Eurovision tropes and moments as they happen during the show.

The project is live at: [https://euroviisubingo.fi](https://euroviisubingo.fi)

The Eurovision Bingo project was created for entertainment purposes to make watching the Eurovision Song Contest even more fun. Players can mark off various Eurovision clichés and memorable moments on their bingo cards as they occur during the live broadcast.

This project was inspired by the non-digital versions of Eurovision Bingo published by the [Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle)](https://yle.fi/a/74-20156509).

## Features

Why use our digital Eurovision Bingo instead of boring paper sheets? Let us count the ways:

- 🌳 **No trees were harmed**: Save the environment! No printer, paper, or ink needed. Your Eurovision experience is now 100% sustainable. No more battles with stubborn printers that mysteriously run out of ink five minutes before the show starts.
- 🖊️ **No more lost pens**: We've all been there – frantically searching for a pen during that key change moment. Digital bingo means no more diving between sofa cushions!
- 🌍 **Multilingual mayhem**: Available in Finnish, English, and French – just like those awkward Eurovision host segments. You can share the fun with you friends from all across the world!
- 💾 **State-of-the-art state saving**: Your bingo progress is saved automatically – even if you take a snack break or your device crashes during a particularly shocking jury vote.
- 🧮 **Mathematical marvel**: With a 5x5 grid and over 60 possible Eurovision moments to fill it, there are astronomically more unique bingo card combinations than stars in the observable universe – guaranteeing a unique experience every time until the heat death of the universe, and then some.
- 🎊 **Celebratory confetti**: Get a bingo and you'll be showered with digital confetti! Try getting that from a paper version without making a mess.
- 📱 **Mobile friendly**: Play discreetly on your phone while pretending to text about how amazing that last performance was.
